                <h2>Data Description</h2>
            </header>
            <div class="row double-column">
                <p>This dataset is a continuation of the PH FinTech Apps Google Store Reviews (2023), which was originally gathered using <strong>RAPIDAPI</strong>. In this updated version, data was collected using <strong>GoogleScraper</strong>, allowing for a more comprehensive and structured extraction of user reviews from the Google Play Store. With <strong>65,535</strong> unique reviews, this dataset provides a robust source for analyzing public perception, user satisfaction, and fintech app performance over time.</p>
                <p>The dataset contains various attributes that capture key aspects of user feedback. Each review entry includes a unique review identifier (reviewId) and a timestamp (review_datime_utc) to track when the review was submitted. Additionally, user information such as author name (author_name) and author identifier (author_name_guid) is included, ensuring that repeated reviews from the same user can be analyzed while maintaining data privacy.</p>
                <p>To assess user sentiment and engagement, the dataset records the review text (review_text), the rating (review_rating) on a scale of 1 to 5, and the number of likes (review_likes) a review has received from other users. These features allow for deeper analysis of how user feedback evolves and how others perceive the value of certain reviews.</p>
                <p>In terms of app-related metadata, each review is linked to a specific fintech application (application_id) and the app version (author_app_version) at the time of the review. This allows researchers to evaluate whether updates lead to higher satisfaction and improved ratings over time.</p>
                <p>The dataset serves multiple purposes, making it an essential tool for fintech developers, data analysts, and researchers. It enables sentiment analysis to track how users perceive fintech apps, trend analysis to evaluate the impact of app updates, and topic modeling to identify key pain points in user feedback. Moreover, it allows comparisons between different fintech developers, highlighting the best and worst-performing apps based on user engagement and satisfaction.</p>
                <p>This dataset is particularly useful for longitudinal studies, as it is continuously updated to reflect real-time changes in user sentiment. By leveraging this data, fintech companies can refine their app development strategies, address user concerns more effectively, and enhance the overall digital financial experience. With its structured format and rich content, this dataset is a valuable resource for understanding the evolving landscape of fintech applications in the Philippines.</p>

                            <li><strong>"Constructive" Reviews Filtering:</strong> Filtered all reviews with a "constructive" score of >= 0.8. </li>
                            <li><strong>"Constructive" Reviews Sampling:</strong> 7000 "constructive" reviews were randomly taken. </li>

                        <h4>Discussion</h4>
                        <p>According to the SHAP bar and beeswarm plots, <strong>user friendliness</strong> and <strong>transaction speed</strong> are the two most significant features impacting review scores.</p>
                        <p>User friendliness had the <strong>lowest mean SHAP</strong> value at <code>-0.052496</code> but the <strong>highest mean absolute SHAP</strong> value of <code>0.634410</code>, meaning it strongly affects ratings and is often a pain point. This suggests many apps underperform in usability, leading to lower reviews.</p>
                        <p>Transaction speed, with a positive mean SHAP of <code>0.017774</code>, indicates that users appreciate apps that "just work" and perform actions quickly. This feature positively correlates with higher ratings.</p>
                        <p>Another insight: <strong>loading speed</strong> (mean absolute SHAP = <code>0.065434</code>, mean SHAP = <code>-0.025441</code>) is the seventh most important feature but contributes to lower ratings. It's closely tied to user friendliness and confirms that app responsiveness remains a common frustration.</p>

                        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                        <p>In conclusion, <strong>user friendliness</strong> and <strong>transaction speed</strong> are the top drivers of fintech app satisfaction. However, many apps struggle with delivering a seamless user experience—highlighting a clear area for improvement.</p>
                        <p>App developers are encouraged to focus on streamlining UI/UX, improving responsiveness, and reducing loading times. Investing in usability and performance will not only boost ratings but build long-term trust and engagement with users.</p>
                        <p>Future research should investigate subcomponents of these key factors, such as specific UI elements, task flows, or common bugs, to pinpoint more targeted recommendations for development teams.</p>

                    <p>Hello! I'm Ethan, a second-year BS Computer Science student at the University of the Philippines - Diliman. Fun fact: During my first semester, I took a biology class—totally outside the CS curriculum—and surprisingly, it turned out to be my favorite subject so far! It was a refreshing detour that sparked a deeper curiosity about the natural world and how it intersects with technology.</p>
