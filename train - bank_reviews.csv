The program is much slower than the previous one. It sometimes shows erroneous errors saying something is wrong with my account but after going to their bank they said my account was fine. The only reason I installed this is because the previous app could no longer show my transaction history but this new app is much too slow and cumbersome even with a good phone and good wifi connection. Unless the slowdowns are addressed my rating will remain as 1 star for this app.,1,feature accessibility
